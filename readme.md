## TIC TAC TOE GAME

About the Project
‚Äã
This project is to build a Tic Tac Toe game which can be played on the command line.
Two human players can play against each other and the board is displayed in between turns.
We built this project following some requirements: 
‚Äã
- The main.rb file should be responsible for user interaction, and this is the only place where puts/print and get.chomp can be used
- Comply with [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) rule
- Set the permission for reading and writing with attr_accessor, attr_reader properly to Classes
- Include the validation for user's inputs to correspond to unpredictable behavior from players
