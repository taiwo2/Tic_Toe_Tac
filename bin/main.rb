TIC_TOE_TAC
Tic-tac-toe is a fun game that you can play any time 
and anywhere as long as you have a piece of paper, a pencil,
 and an opponent. Tic-tac-toe is a zero sum game, which means that
 
  if both players are playing their best, that neither player will win.
   However, if you learn how to play tic-tac-toe and master some simple
    strategies, then you will be able to not only play, but to win the majority of
     the time. If you want to know how to play tic-tac-toe, then see Step 1 to get started.
     
   #step 1
Draw the board. First, you have to draw the board, which is 
made up of a 3 x 3 grid of squares. This means it has three rows of
 three squares. Some people play with a 4 x 4 grid, but that is for more advanced players, 
and we will focus on the 3 x 3 grid here.
#step 3
Have the first player go first. Though traditionally, the
 first player goes with "X", you can allow the first player to 
 decide whether he wants to go with "X"s or "O"s. These symbols will be
  placed on the table, in the attempt to have three of them in a row. 
  If you are going first, then the best move you can make is to move into 
  the center. This will maximize your chances of winning, since you will 
  be able to create a row of three "X"s or "O"s in more combinations (4) this 
way than if you chose a different square.
#step 4
Have the second player go second. After the first player goes, 
then the second player should put down his symbol, which will be 
different from the symbol of the first player. The second player can
 either try to block the first player from creating a row of three, 
 or focus on creating his or her own row of three.
 Ideally, the player can do both.

 step5
 Keep alternating moves until one of the players has 
 drawn a row of three symbols or until no one can win. 
 The first player to draw three of his or her symbols in a row,
  whether it is horizontal, vertical, or diagonal, has won tic-tac-toe.
   will be declare  and prompted as
   # puts 'you win on the board'
   otherwise
   puts  'you lose on the board for other player'
   However, if both players are playing with optimal strategy, then there is a good 
   chance that no one will win because you will have blocked one another opportunities to create a row of three
   # puts 'Draw'
 step6
 Keep practicing. Contrary to popular belief, tic-tac-toe is not purely a game of chance.
  There are some strategies that can help you optimize your skills and to become an expert 
  tic-tac-toe player. If you keep playing, you will soon learn all of the tricks to making 
  sure you win every time -- or, at least, you will learn the tricks to make sure you 
 never lose. Its like 0's and x's.
